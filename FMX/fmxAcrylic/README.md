fmxAcrylic
----------

Just a simple demo trying to mimic Windows 10/11 Acrylic blur in Firemonkey apps.

It has secondary window to hold shadow and using hooks it allows to keep aligned to primary window.

TODO:?  

- [ ] Hide it before minimizing to block showing it bottom left briefly
- [ ] Resize hooks
- [ ] Pick main form as thumbnail instead of shadow
- [ ] ...
